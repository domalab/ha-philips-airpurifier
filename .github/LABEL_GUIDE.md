## üîÑ Label Workflow

### Automatic Label Assignment
- **Device Support Request**: `device-support`, `enhancement`
- **Bug Report**: `bug`
- **Feature Request**: `enhancement`

### Manual Label Assignment Guidelines

#### For Device Support Requests:
1. Add device type: `device: air-purifier`, `device: humidifier`, or `device: combo`
2. Add priority based on device popularity and feasibility
3. Add `status: needs-data` if more information is required
4. Add `status: in-progress` when development starts
5. Add `status: testing` when ready for user testing

#### For Bug Reports:
1. Add component label based on the affected functionality
2. Add device type if issue is device-specific
3. Add priority based on severity and impact
4. Add `status: needs-data` if reproduction steps or logs are needed

#### For Feature Requests:
1. Add component label for the affected area
2. Add priority based on user impact and implementation complexity
3. Add device type if feature is device-specific

## üìä Label Usage Examples

### Device Support Request Example:
```
Labels: device-support, enhancement, device: air-purifier, priority: medium, status: needs-data
```

### Bug Report Example:
```
Labels: bug, component: connectivity, device: combo, priority: high, status: in-progress
```

### Feature Request Example:
```
Labels: enhancement, component: services, priority: low, status: testing
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Label Management

### Adding New Labels
Use the GitHub API or web interface to create new labels following the naming conventions:
- `category: specific-item` format for grouped labels
- Consistent color schemes within categories
- Clear, descriptive names and descriptions

### Color Scheme
- **Red (`#d73a4a`)**: High priority, critical issues
- **Orange (`#fbca04`)**: Medium priority, warnings
- **Green (`#0e8a16`)**: Low priority, success states
- **Blue (`#0052cc`)**: In progress, informational
- **Purple (`#5319e7`)**: Component categories
- **Light Green (`#c2e0c6`)**: Device types
- **Light Yellow (`#fef2c0`)**: Status indicators

This label system provides comprehensive organization while maintaining simplicity and consistency.
